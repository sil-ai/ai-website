# SIL RAIL-M License v1.0

This is a license (the “**License**”) between you (“**You**”) and SIL International (“**Licensor**”). 
This Responsible AI License ([RAIL](https://www.licenses.ai/)) aims at SIL’s goal of working openly and permissively while striving 
for responsible use of the **Model**.



### Section I: PREAMBLE

The lack of freely-available, pre-trained Natural Language Processing (“**NLP**”) models in the majority of the world’s languages 
is concerning, and there is a need to greatly expand the linguistic diversity represented in mainstream **NLP** research. 
However, the release of open access models and datasets representing **Indigenous People** can also backfire into exploitation 
of or discrimination against these same communities. 

This RAIL-M License, created by SIL International, strives to facilitate the public release of **NLP** models representing 
indigenous languages while safeguarding against downstream usage that might harm those in indigenous communities.

As it relates to access, distribution, and general responsible use, we took inspiration from Open RAIL-M licenses, 
such as the CreativeML Open RAIL-M license. The notable difference here 
(which shifts the current license into a RAIL-M category rather than an Open RAIL-M category) 
is a restriction on downstream commercial use of the **Model**. This use restriction is meant to prevent exploitative downstream use 
without any clear benefits flowing back to indigenous communities. 

Further, we introduce use-based restrictions not permitting the use of the **Model** in scenarios that would harm 
or enable discrimination against **Indigenous People** as outlined in Articles 2; 13-16; and 31 of the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous People.

This License governs the use of the **Model** (and its derivatives) and is informed by the Model card associated with the **Model**. 
Publicly released derivative versions of the **Model** will always have to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions 
as the ones in the original license (this license).

**NOW THEREFORE**, **You** and **Licensor** agree as follows:

**1. Definitions**
<ol type="a">
  <li>"<b>License</b>" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in this document.</li>
  <li>“<b>Data</b>” means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the dataset used with the Model, including 
  to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License.</li>
  <li>“<b>Output</b>” means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom.</li>
  <li>“<b>Model</b>” means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, 
  parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, 
  that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part on the Data, using the Complementary Material.</li>
  <li>“<b>Derivatives of the Model</b>” means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which 
  is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, 
  to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - 
  distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data 
  by the Model for training the other model.</li>
  <li>“<b>Complementary Material</b>” means the accompanying source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or 
  evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any accompanying documentation, 
  tutorials, examples, etc, if any.</li>
  <li> “<b>Distribution</b>” means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model 
  to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. 
  API-based or web access.</li>
  <li>“<b>Licensor</b>” means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is granting the License, 
  including the persons or entities that may have rights in the Model and/or distributing the Model.</li>
  <li>“<b>You</b>” (or “<b>Your</b>”) means an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or 
  making use of the Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application 
  - e.g. chatbot, translator, image generator.</li>
  <li>“<b>Third Parties</b>” means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with Licensor or You.</li>
  <li>“<b>Contribution</b>” means any work of authorship, including the original version of the Model and any modifications or 
  additions to that Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in 
  the Model by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. 
  For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the 
  Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control 
  systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and 
  improving the Model, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the 
  copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."</li>
  <li>“<b>Contributor</b>” means Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received 
  by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Model.</li>
  <li>“<b>Indigenous People</b>” means, in accordance with The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, any group 
  of people that self-identifies as indigenous in accordance with their customs and traditions. By way of example and 
  without limitation, Indigenous People may include: (i) tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural and 
  economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community and whose status is regulated wholly or 
  partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations; (ii) peoples in independent countries who regard 
  themselves and are regarded by others as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, 
  or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonization or the establishment of present 
  state boundaries and who irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and 
  political institutions; (iii) peoples otherwise described by i and/or ii who have been forcefully displaced from their country of
  origin or those who traditionally have maintained and continue to maintain a nomadic or itinerant lifestyle.</li>
  <li>“<b>Commercial Use</b>” means any use of the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material primarily intended 
  for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.</li>
  <li>“<b>Natural Language</b>” means spoken, signed, or written communication as used by a community of people in their daily life 
  and for their own purposes.</li>
  <li>“<b>Natural Language Processing</b>” (or “NLP”) means machine or computer methods (often a Model) that allow computers to understand 
  and communicate using Natural Language</li>
</ol>



### **Section II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

Both copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material. 
The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III.

**2. Grant of Copyright License**
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
