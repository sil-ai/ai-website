AQuA is a copilot tool developed by SIL Global that seeks to develop capacity and increase the thoroughness 
of translation quality assurance. 
It harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, assisting translation teams in assessing multiple facets 
of translation quality by *enhancing* and *complementing* their quality assurance work. 
After running several quality assessment algorithms on a Bible translation, AQuA provides different visualizations 
showcasing different properties of the text. Translation teams can then review these visualizations to help them see 
their translation in a new light.

Our hope is that AQuA would empower translation teams in the quality checking process, 
helping them to more easily spot the obvious errors, which in turn lets them focus more of their precious time 
and attention on the parts of a draft that really need their expertise. Several teams have used AQuA to find errors
in their draft that otherwise would have likely made their way to print.
