Faithbridge is a reliable AI-powered Bible Q&A app that enables local language translators to interact

through thousands of translation resources and helps them find exactly the documents they need 
to learn about the context behind passages they are translating. Faithbridge provides answers based on resources 
(including images and videos) found within the <a href="http://aquifer.bible" target="_blank">Bible Aquifier</a>.
