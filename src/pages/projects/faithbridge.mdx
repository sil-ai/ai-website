# Faithbridge

Faithbridge is a project that represents SILâ€™s research and development implementing more controllable 
and trustworthy generative AI chat by augmenting a language model with trusted documents.

SIL has prototyped an AI chat app to answer Bible and Bible Translation related questions 
based on the trusted resources found within 
the <a href="http://aquifer.bible" target="_blank">Bible Aquifier</a>. The App is designed 
to be multilingual and also to answer with real (not generated) image or video resources where available.

You can sign up to try the app for yourself <a href="https://faithbridge.multilingualai.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

SIL was also awarded the 2024 MissioNexus Innovation Grant to develop an AI Copilot 
for Online Missionaries in partnership with Global Media Outreach (GMO), designed 
to give real-time feedback and suggestions to Online Missionaries engaged in digital discipleship.
