# Acts2

Acts2 is a service that leverages the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence to provide state-of-the-art 
translation and text-to-speech into a wide range of languages. While SIL’s Serval and Scripture Forge 
focus on machine translation for Biblical text, Acts2 builds upon these tools. It extends their capabilities 
to work with materials related to education, development, trauma healing, anti-trafficking, and more. 


The inspiration for ‘Acts2’ comes from the description of Pentecost found in that chapter of the Bible 
where we see God’s heart for connecting with people in their own language. The last several years have seen 
tremendous advances in machine translation capabilities for high-resource languages, however, 
the same level of progress has not yet been seen for lower-resource languages. This has largely been due to 
lower levels of data availability and less economic demand for translation into languages with fewer speakers. 
With Acts2, we are able to make use of SIL’s extensive multilingual parallel data from Scripture translations 
and other sources. We use these data to fine-tune machine translation models that achieve better results 
in low-resource languages, helping bridge the gap these traditionally underserved language communities face.


## Using Acts2

Acts2 is now available through a UI and also via API. 
We have trial user accounts available upon request where users can try out 
different translation models and run their own text-to-speech.

</div>

Users can select from currently available models in more than 200 languages, 
with fine-tuned models for more than 1,400 languages in total available upon request. 
While some models are only available for non-profit use due to their licensing terms, 
the majority of languages covered by Acts2 do have at least one model available which is licensed 
for commercial use. New models can also be fine-tuned on user-provided data when requested 
for permissively licensed parallel corpora. 

As a professional service, Acts2 aims to make the translation process easy and painless. 
We have expanded the range of upload and download options accepted by Acts2, and now support SFM and docx 
(experimental) file types, in addition to CSVs, text files, and an option for pasting in text directly. 
We've also made it possible for text-to-speech to be used directly on uploaded text, rather than only 
on translated text. 
 

## Reviewing results

As with the best machine translation available today, results from Acts2 still require human review. 
As an optional feature, this review, along with editing and rating of translations from different models, 
can be completed directly within the Acts2 UI. This makes it easier to manage translation projects 
while also providing feedback which can be incorporated into model improvements.

## Pricing

We aim to provide affordable and competitive pricing for Acts2 services. 
Three tiers are available for translation, allowing for flexibility according to budget and project needs. 
The Professional tier offers the best support for most projects, covering hundreds of languages, 
several translation model options, and rapidly developing experimental features, including translation 
suggestions, HTML/docx/SFM formatting preservation, and a glossary feature. It starts at US 0.2 cents 
per word for the first 1 million words and is half that much after 1 million words. 
Custom fine-tuned models in up to 1,400 languages are available upon request at 1 cent per word 
for the first 1 million words and 0.5 cents per word after that. The Basic tier is an ultra-low-cost 
alternative, providing only translation in up to 60 languages starting at 0.028 cents per word and also 
dropping to half price after 1 million words.

</div>

Text-to-speech pricing ranges from $0.14/minute to $1.14/minute depending on the language. 
While this service is available in over 1,000 languages, quality is known to vary considerably 
across this range. We are actively in the process of training new text-to-speech models to provide 
higher quality and an even broader range of languages.
