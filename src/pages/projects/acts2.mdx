# Acts 2

Acts 2 is our translation service aimed at non-scripture text and audio going out into a wide range of languages. 
We focus on leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine translation to more widely disseminate resources related to education, 
development, trauma healing, and more. We make use of SILâ€™s extensive multilingual parallel data, 
from Scripture translations and other sources, to fine-tune translation models for better results in lower resource languages, 
helping to bridge the gap faced by traditionally underserved language communities.
