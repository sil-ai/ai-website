# Scripture Forge

Scripture Forge is an online app for team-based Bible translation, 
featuring AI help and tools for community review.

## Overview

- **Translation Drafting**: Scripture Forge uses artificial intelligence to generate rough drafts 
based on previously translated Scripture. When a project contains about 8000 verses across multiple genres, 
draft generation can provide a draft of the next book for the project or back translation, 
helping teams maintain consistency and naturalness. 
Earlier in the translation project, teams can use the Translation Suggestions to generate predicted words 
and phrases for the current verse based on already-translated verses.
- **Editing**: Teams can draft and edit translations collaboratively, without worrying about keeping track 
of multiple conflicting versions. Paratext integration and ongoing synchronization keeps your project 
up-to-date and allows user feedback via Paratext Notes.
- **Community Checking**: Teams can invite non-Paratext users to review translations, 
add comments, and answer questions about the translation. Translation teams and community checkers 
can interact via typed text and audio recording.

## Features

- Integrated with Paratext projects, roles, and notes.
- Works seamlessly on both mobile devices and desktops.
- Fully supports audio for Scripture checking, including text syncing via timing files.
- Offline functionality stores data locally that can be synced later once an internet connection is re-established.

## Future Development
Scripture Forge will continue to offer new tooling to support multiple translation workflows. 
Release of the first version of the integrated Lynx editor is scheduled for late 2024 to provide access 
to AI-enabled text checking for low-resource languages as well as integrated quality checks through 
the <a href="/projects/AQuA" target="_blank">Augmented Quality Assessment (AQuA)</a> project.
