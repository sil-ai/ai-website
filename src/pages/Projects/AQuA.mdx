# Augmented Quality Assessment (AQuA)

AQuA seeks to develop capacity and increase the pace of translation quality assurance. AQuA harnesses the latest 
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist human reviewers in objectively assessing multiple facets of 
translation quality. AQuA is able to produce an increasingly detailed suite of quality-related diagnostics, with at 
least five augmented quality assessment methods in the areas of accuracy, clarity, and naturalness. 

AQuA helps to develop capacity and increase the pace of Bible translation while ensuring quality throughout the translation community.

To this end, AQuA is creating:

1. power tools for translation consultants, which will allow them to do their checking work more thoroughly and more consistently;
2. an early warning system for translators, which will alert them to obvious problems so they can address them earlier in the translation process;
3. an equalizer for administrators and strategists, which will allow them to compare and evaluate methodologies and products on an equal footing (including new AI-based translation methodologies proposed by TBTA, SIL, and Avodah).

By identifying possibly problematic or anomalous passages in a draft, AQuA accelerates the quality assessment process by helping:

- translators make corrections (and produce an improved draft) prior to consultant checks;
- consultants gain an “at-a-glance” understand of quality across a draft and quickly dig into the relevant, granular quality issues; and
- administrators and project managers track quality across projects to guide strategic allocations of checking resources.
