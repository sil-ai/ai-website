# Augmented Quality Assessment (AQuA)

## Overview

## Why AI?

We are seeing an explosion of interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven tools that are paired as “copilots” with human workers. These include copilots that are helping users:

- Write code [^1],
- Find sales leads [^2],
- Draft legal documents [^3],
- Generate design ideas [^4],
- Create lesson plans [^5]
- Much more.

The term copilot in these instances drives home two important points:

1. A human user is in control of the process (i.e., they are the pilot)
2. The human user’s work is enhanced when it is assisted by AI-driven tooling 
(in terms of efficiency, thoroughness, creativity, or some other key performance indicator)

To drive home this trend, consider the case of radiologists. 
These are medical doctors who undergo years of specialty training to diagnose diseases through imaging procedures 
like X-rays and MRIs. As highlighted in the New York Times:

> Machine learning systems [a type of AI systems] have made computers very good at this sort of task; 
> if you feed a computer enough chest X-rays showing diseases, for instance, it can learn to diagnose those conditions 
> — often faster and with accuracy rivaling or exceeding that of human doctors. [^6]

So, what is the best way to deploy this kind of AI driven capability? 
In a 2019 paper in the journal Radiology Artificial Intelligence [^7], 
Curtis Langlotz, a radiologist at Stanford, points out that computers may still lack data 
to diagnose rarer conditions (i.e, edge cases), even if they are able to diagnose common conditions. 
Langlotz thus concludes that:

> “Will A.I. replace radiologists?” is “the wrong question.” Instead, he wrote, 
> “The right answer is: Radiologists who use A.I. will replace radiologists who don’t.”

In Bible Translation, we also have individuals (translators and consultants) that undergo years of specialty training 
to diagnose quality issues in translation drafts. Computational methods, such as those being developed 
by the Augmented Quality Assessment (AQuA) and Clear Bible teams, are increasingly able to locate anomalies and issues 
within translation drafts. However, they will always fail to identify certain edge case quality issues or issues related 
to some of the important threads of the multithreaded translation quality fabric.

Thus, we argue in this paper that AI tools should act as copilots, helping stakeholders in the translation process 
to efficiently and thoroughly evaluate certain qualities of a draft translation. This is consistent with how these kinds of tools 
have transformed other industries, and it is consistent with their limitations and capabilities.
