# tools.bible

[Tools.Bible](https://tools.bible) was created (in partnership with [Biblica](https://www.biblica.com/)) to offer an easy-to-use centralized library of all tools available in the Bible translation ecosystem. We have gathered data on features, capabilities, use-cases, and even testimonials from those who have first-hand experience using them on translation projects, making all that critical information searchable so that you can find the tools you need today.

## Mission

To provide a globally accessible online library of tools for every step in the Bible translation process.

## Goals

- Provide a centralized library where translators can find all the translation tools for each of the different Bible translation phases.
- Make Bible translation easier and more efficient by connecting translators to toolsâ€”and helping translation teams know where tools can augment & enhance their existing work.
- Make it easy for organizations to submit their tools for inclusion in the platform.
